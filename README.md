# Morgan's Ultranauts <abbr title="software test automation">STA</abbr> Portfolio

This repository contains evidence of my personal technical capability for <abbr title="software test automation">STA</abbr> projects at Ultranauts. My goal is to make this repository as comprehensive as possible with respect to what I know. Each folder contains one of two things, either:

1. A `README.md` file (formatted as described below) and a link to the repository where the actual sample code exists, or
2. Sample code snippets or a project demonstrating my proficiency with one language or framework, including:
   * A `README.md` file that contains
     * The dates or timespan when the code was written
     * A short description of what language or framework is being demonstrated
     * A short explanation of why this language or framework is useful or valuable to Ultranauts
     * The project(s) in which I've used this skill or a link to the tutorial followed when producing it
     * The specific files, or parts of files on which reviewers should focus
     * A short explanation of why these files were chosen as examples
     * If the code was from a tutorial, how I've modified it to demonstrate understanding/proficiency
     * Instructions on:
       * How to download/clone this code (if not obvious)
       * How to setup an environment to run it (also if not obvious)
       * How to compile and actually run it (if possible/applicable)
     * Comments or other notes about the technology and/or my experience with it
     * A description and/or screenshots/screencapture of the code running or its key outputs
   * The actual code sample
   * Other supporting files, e.g. screenshots

> <font size="5">‚≠ê</font>This is a "one stop shop" for ALL of my code samples. Any code that I want to be evaluated as part of my portfolio will either be *in* this repo or linked to *from* this repo.

## Portfolio Contents

* [Playwright (TypeScript)](/playwright-sample)<br>
<abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> and <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> tests using the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework. Runnable. Shows framwork setup and actual tests. Implemented with TypeScript.
* [SQL (with Python and Jupyter Notebook)](/sql)<br>
