# Morgan's Ultranauts <abbr title="software test automation">STA</abbr> Portfolio

This repository contains evidence of my personal technical capability for <abbr title="software test automation">STA</abbr> projects at Ultranauts. Each folder contains sample code demonstrating my proficiency with one language or framework and contains the following elements:

* A `README.md` file that contains
  * The dates or timespan when the code was written
  * A short description of what language or framework is being demonstrated
  * A short explanation of why this language or framework is useful or valuable to Ultranauts
  * The project(s) in which I've used this skill or a link to the tutorial followed when producing it
  * The specific files, or parts of files on which reviewers should focus
  * A short explanation of why these files were chosen as examples
  * If the code was from a tutorial, how I've modified it to demonstrate understanding/proficiency
  * Instructions on:
    * How to download/clone this code (if not obvious)
    * How to setup an environment to run it (also if not obvious)
    * How to compile and actually run it (if possible/applicable)
  * Comments or other notes about the technology and/or my experience with it
  * A description and/or screenshots/screencapture of the code running or its key outputs
* The actual code sample
* Other supporting files, e.g. screenshots
